## [How to Cross a River](https://msmith0913.github.io/how-to-cross-a-river)

This scrollytelling story documents issues of regional connectivity and transit infrastructure in metro St. Louis. It was built using the [Scrolly Story Generator](https://github.com/IRISSIUE/scrolly-story-generator), developed by the [IRIS Center](https://iris.siue.edu) at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. (In fact, it was developed as a [tutorial](https://github.com/IRISSIUE/scrollytelling-tutorial) for the Scrolly Story Generator.) But it's also part of a larger effort on my part to spotlight infrastructural failures and spatial injustice in St. Louis and to advocate for enhanced regional connectivity. For instance, you can find my #WeekWithoutDriving2024 posts turned into a [digital timeline](https://iris.siue.edu/weekwithoutdriving/) that follows my transit usage over the course of the week and offers some suggestions for improvements by regional transit providers.

More broadly, this project is a small piece of a much larger research agenda focused on complex relationships between people, land, and power. I'm a medieval historian by training, and you can find a variety of projects that fall under this umbrella related both to medieval Ireland and to metro St. Louis at [Sites of Negotiation](https://sitesofnegotiation.margaretksmith.com/).
